To a large extent it depends on most TCP implementations using the same congestion control algorithm, or at least algorithms that have the same general behavior.

When a TCP connection implementing the NewReno algorithm shares a congested link with another one implementing BBR, the BBR grabs the lion&#x27;s share of the bandwidth:</p><p>&gt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ripe76.ripe.net&#x2F;presentations&#x2F;10-2018-05-15-bbr.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ripe76.ripe.net&#x2F;presentations&#x2F;10-2018-05-15-bbr.pdf</a></p><p>&gt;QUIC specifies NewReno as default and mentions CUBIC, but the choice of algorithm is left to the implementation.

Many networking kits are based on reliable UDP and common early implementations as the core&#x2F;base of their network layers such as enet [2] or RakNet [3] (Unity, Unreal, Sony, Oculus and more).  RUDP or variants are UDP with channels, ordering, priority as well as ACKs where needed for reliable&#x2F;must deliver messages through the use of a return UDP ACK datagram for verification. Reliable UDP is a set of service enhancement such as congestion control, retransmission, thinning server algorithms that allow a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for media broadcasts even in the presence of packet loss and network congestion.</p><p>Reliable UDP ACKS are used commonly in areas like global events such as game start, game end, player entered, player died, player hit etc, all other positioning&#x2F;action is UDP broadcast with dropped packets lerped [5] and slerped [6] out with interpolation [7] and extrapolation to deal with lag compensation [8] and client prediction [9][10][11]. Sometimes this also involves channels and grid&#x2F;graph areas where only messages to players around you or in that area are required to ACK when needed i.e. player hit&#x2F;death.</p><p>Most large real-time games are just UDP broadcast for 99% of action. TCP is almost never used in real-time action games like FPS, MMO, RTS etc.</p><p>Rarely are TCP and UDP combined, rather RUDP or later something like SCTP, allows streaming&#x2F;real-time capable broadcasts with enough verification&#x2F;reliable messages where needed. Combining TCP and UDP can end up with queuing issues that affect both TCP and UDP traffic [4] so most games just go with reliable variant of UDP.</p><p>Gaffer on Games has a good section on why UDP is used in games [12]</p><p>&gt; <i>The web is built on top of TCP, which is a reliable-ordered protocol.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>To deliver data reliably and in order under packet loss, it is necessary for TCP to hold more recent data in a queue while waiting for dropped packets to be resent. Otherwise, data would be delivered out of order.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>This is called head of line blocking and it creates a frustrating and almost comedically tragic problem for game developers. The most recent data they want is delayed while waiting for old data to be resent, but by the time the resent data arrives, it’s too old to be used.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>Unfortunately, there is no way to fix this behavior under TCP. All data must be received reliably and in order. Therefore, the standard solution in the game industry for the past 20 years has been to send game data over UDP instead.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>How this works in practice is that each game develops their own custom protocol on top of UDP, implementing basic reliability as required, while sending the majority of data as unreliable-unordered. This ensures that time series data arrives as quickly as possible without waiting for dropped packets to be resent.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>So, what does this have to do with web games? The main problem for web games today is that game developers have no way to follow this industry best practice in the browser. Instead, web games send their game data over TCP, causing hitches and non-responsiveness due to head of line blocking.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>This is completely unnecessary and could be fixed overnight if web games had some way to send and receive UDP packets.</i></p><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ietf.org&#x2F;proceedings&#x2F;44&#x2F;I-D&#x2F;draft-ietf-sigtran-reliable-udp-00.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ietf.org&#x2F;proceedings&#x2F;44&#x2F;I-D&#x2F;draft-ietf-sigtran-r...</a></p><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;enet.bespin.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;enet.bespin.org&#x2F;</a></p><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;RakNet\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;RakNet</a></p><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20180704154418&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.isoc.org&#x2F;inet97&#x2F;proceedings&#x2F;F3&#x2F;F3_1.HTM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20180704154418&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.isoc....</a></p><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Linear_interpolation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Linear_interpolation</a></p><p>[6] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Slerp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Slerp</a></p><p>[7] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.valvesoftware.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Interpolation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.valvesoftware.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Interpolation</a></p><p>[8] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.valvesoftware.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lag_compensation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.valvesoftware.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lag_compensation</a></p><p>[9] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.valvesoftware.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Prediction\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.valvesoftware.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Prediction</a></p><p>[10] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gafferongames.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;snapshot_compression&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gafferongames.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;snapshot_compression&#x2F;</a></p><p>[11] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gafferongames.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;snapshot_interpolation&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gafferongames.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;snapshot_interpolation&#x2F;</a></p><p>[12]  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gafferongames.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;why_cant_i_send_udp_packets_from_a_browser&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gafferongames.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;why_cant_i_send_udp_packets_f...</a></p>","points":null,"parent_id":18519254,"story_id":18517047,"children":[],"options":[]}],"options":[]}],"options":[]}],"options":[]},{"id":18518238,"created_at":"2018-11-23T18:58:20.000Z","created_at_i":1542999500,"type":"comment","author":"tyingq","title":null,"url":null,"text":"<p>That&#x27;s because other UDP based protocols don&#x27;t have tcp like sequence numbers or other anti-spoofing measures.

Whereas months of arguing and back-and-forth technical discussion have shaped the IETF&#x27;s QUIC and will continue to do so, the documentation for MSCHAPv2 (commonly used in corporate WiFi deployments) is an informational RFC so a Microsoft employee just dumped it as written, no chance for anyone to say &quot;Er, this protocol is stupid, change it not to shove zero bytes into this key labelled C or else anybody can crack user passwords after spoofing the AP&quot;.

That&#x27;s <i>such</i> a C++ (or C) mindset: that using dependencies is bad, which stems from the difficulty of adding and updating dependencies in the C++ world.</p><p>In a language with a rock solid package manager, it&#x27;s better to have a small core and then pull in what you need. Each of these out-of-core dependencies can have separate lifecycles, which makes it a lot easier for them to be developed and updated, making them higher quality. If breaking changes need to be made, that can easily be done in out-of-core libraries, since existing projects can continue depending on their SemVer-defined compatible version of the dependency ad infinitum, and the project maintainers can continue releasing updates to any SemVer series of the package if they need to backport changes to older versions. When something is in the core, it&#x27;s very hard to update it while maintaining complete compatibility, and people can only depend on one version of your core library at a time, so there&#x27;s no room to be flexible. This constricts growth, since the core needs to meet <i>everyone&#x27;s</i> needs, but it doesn&#x27;t have the flexibility to do that as the world changes, so it often meets <i>no one&#x27;s</i> needs.</p><p>I don&#x27;t know how good Dart&#x27;s package manager is, since I haven&#x27;t really touched Dart since the very earliest days of the language after it became public, but Rust&#x27;s package manager is excellent, and having most things out-of-std has been great for the community. Futures and async have flourished out-of-std and gone through several very different approaches to gain real world experience. Some very small pieces of that ecosystem will be stabilized into the core language soon, but only the most bare minimum features to add the &quot;await&quot; keyword to the language.

But that is not the original point.</p><p>In MVC as it was originally understood, a model is a list of subscribers. You can add yourself to that list, you can remove yourself from that list, and whenever a “value” changes, if you are on that list, you get a notification that the value has changed. You have a couple of different designs of these, depending on whether you want to send a current-state message as a notification on subscription, or just give everybody read access to the current state. The latter commits you to initializing your models in ways that indicate the absence or staleness of data (someone loads your app, you need to send out a network request to get a new thing) but also allows you to use variable scope to augment how much multiplexing and state tracking you need.</p><p>Models vary from data models in having view-relevant data. So for example you switch from the type</p><p><pre><code>    const urlList = new Model&lt;UrlRow[]&gt;([])\n</code></pre>\nto the type</p><p><pre><code>    type Fetching&lt;x&gt; = { state: &quot;init&quot; }\n      | { state: &quot;loaded&quot;, data: x },\n      | { state: &quot;fetching&quot;, staleData: x },\n      | { state: &quot;fetch error&quot;, staleData: null | x }\n    const urlList = new Model&lt;Fetching&lt;UrlRow[]&gt;&gt;({\n      state: &quot;init&quot;\n    })\n</code></pre>\nNotice that these Fetching indicator statuses are a part of the data model for the UI, not the underlying data model that exists at the database level.</p><p>If this begins to feel a lot like React and Redux, that is because there is a shared lineage there. React originally made its splash as “the V in MVC” but its setState&#x2F;state system, while it doesn&#x27;t contain a subscriber list, effectively does something equivalent by insisting on destroying anything that has the old values and then superficially identifying things which appeared to remain the same from moment to moment, with the basic model then being a “subscription tree.”</p><p>Redux of course takes this from being a tree to being something more generic by making the store global... I think that models should not be app-global the way that Redux likes (it does not want to solve the problem of multiplexing models, which is understandable but it turns out to be a much simpler problem than you&#x27;d think) and that the pattern of reducers is more verbose than one generally needs, but I love the time travel browser features that Redux gives me. Somehow Redux has encouraged abominations like redux-thunk which complect separate concerns into the same dispatch function unnecessarily.

To fill this need, a global mechanism in <i>Object</i> is provided to keep track of dependencies such as those between a model and its view. This mechanism uses an <i>IdentityDictionary</i> called <i>DependentFields</i> (a class variable of <i>Object</i>) which simply records all existing dependencies. The keys in this dictionary are all the objects that have registered dependencies; the value associated with each key is a list of the objects which depend upon the key. In addition to this general mechanism, the class <i>Model</i> provides a more efficient mechanism for managing dependents. When you create new classes that are intended to function as active models in an MVC triad, you should make them subclasses of <i>Model</i>. Models in this hierarchy retain their dependents in an instance variable (<i>dependents</i>) which holds either nil, a single dependent object, or an instance of <i>DependentsCollection</i>. Views rely on these dependence mechanisms to notify them of changes in the model. When a new view is given its model, it registers itself as a dependent of that model. When the view is released, it removes itself as a dependent.</p><p>Like, I&#x27;m not getting this out of nowhere; at one point I inspected the code in the Model object and that&#x27;s how it works...</p>","points":null,"parent_id":18518944,"story_id":18515565,"children":[],"options":[]}],"options":[]},{"id":18518992,"created_at":"2018-11-23T21:25:11.000Z","created_at_i":1543008311,"type":"comment","author":"acemarke","title":null,"url":null,"text":"<p>Hi, I&#x27;m a Redux maintainer.</p><p>Could you clarify why you feel that redux-thunk is an &quot;abomination&quot;?

If you do this, you can have a bunch of local stores and still say &quot;this component&#x27;s value changes whenever either of those values change.&quot; The key is that &quot;normal&quot; models accept a set(value) message to set their value to something, and you might play around with &quot;dict&quot; models which accept insert(key, value), deleteAt(key) messages, but a multiplex model would not be easily able to abstract over all the different possible messages to send upstream and so the easiest approach is just to make multiplexes nonresponsive -- you can&#x27;t &quot;dispatch&quot; to them, in Redux terms.</p><p>redux-thunk is nice in that it helps keep people from making the mistake of sending otherwise-no-op actions to the store which then, inside a reducer as side-effects, do a bunch of async I&#x2F;O to compute events that eventually make it back to the store. I would broadly agree with that.</p><p>My basic beef with redux-thunk is that it&#x27;s unnecessary and complicates what would otherwise be a type signature that has no reference to I&#x2F;O, which I regard as a good thing. Developers ought to know that, to quote one of the Austin Powers movies, &quot;you had the mojo all along.&quot; It&#x27;s a sort of talisman that you are using for purely psychological reasons to reassure developers and to coax them to doing updates outside of the reducers, but it&#x27;s OK because &quot;it&#x27;s in `dispatch()` so it must be a Redux thing so we&#x27;ll make it work.&quot; But such a talisman is unnecessary.</p><p>Like, here&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve got (in the readme):</p><p><pre><code>    function makeASandwichWithSecretSauce(forPerson) {\n      return function (dispatch) {\n        return fetchSecretSauce().then(\n          sauce =&gt; dispatch(makeASandwich(forPerson, sauce)),\n          error =&gt; dispatch(apologize(&#x27;The Sandwich Shop&#x27;, forPerson, error))\n        );\n      };\n    }\n    store.dispatch(\n      makeASandwichWithSecretSauce(&#x27;Me&#x27;)\n    );\n</code></pre>\nHere it is with simpler type signatures:</p><p><pre><code>    function makeASandwichWithSecretSauce(forPerson, dispatch) {\n      return fetchSecretSauce().then(\n        sauce =&gt; dispatch(makeASandwich(forPerson, sauce)),\n        error =&gt; dispatch(apologize(&#x27;The Sandwich Shop&#x27;, forPerson, error))\n      );\n    }\n    makeASandwichWithSecretSauce(&#x27;Me&#x27;, msg =&gt; store.dispatch(msg));\n</code></pre>\nThe indirection here wouldn&#x27;t even be necessary if Redux core just preventatively declared when creating a store that</p><p><pre><code>    store.dispatch = Store.prototype.dispatch.bind(store);\n    store.getState = Store.prototype.getState.bind(store);\n</code></pre>\nwhich I mean maybe you do; I don&#x27;t know.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":18518992,"story_id":18515565,"children":[{"id":18519597,"created_at":"2018-11-24T00:02:03.000Z","created_at_i":1543017723,"type":"comment","author":"acemarke","title":null,"url":null,"text":"<p>Erm.... that&#x27;s bizarre.

I&#x27;ll try to give some thoughts here, but I don&#x27;t know if this is going to answer things because I don&#x27;t know what point you&#x27;re actually trying to make.</p><p>The point of `redux-thunk` is to allow you to write logic that needs access to `dispatch` and `getState` when it runs, but without binding it to specific references of `dispatch` and `getState` ahead of time.</p><p>If you wanted to, you _could_ just directly `import {store} from &quot;.&#x2F;myStore&quot;`, and directly call `store.dispatch(someAction)`.  But, A) that doesn&#x27;t scale well in an actual app, and B) it ties you to that one store instance, making it harder to reuse any of the logic or test it.</p><p>In a typical React-Redux app, the actual specific store instance gets injected into the component tree by rendering `&lt;Provider store={store}&gt;` around the root component.  As my slides point out, you _could_ still directly grab a reference to `props.dispatch` and do async work in the component, but that&#x27;s also not generally a good pattern.  By moving the async logic into its own function, and ultimately injecting `(dispatch, getState)` into that function, it&#x27;s more portable and reusable.</p><p>Also, have you seen the actual implementation of `redux-thunk`?  It&#x27;s short enough that I&#x27;ll paste it in here just for emphasis:</p><p><pre><code>    return ({ dispatch, getState }) =&gt; next =&gt; action =&gt; {\n        if (typeof action === &#x27;function&#x27;) {\n            return action(dispatch, getState);\n        }\n        return next(action);\n    };\n\n</code></pre>\nIf you can try to clarify what you&#x27;re saying about &quot;type signatures&quot; and binding the methods from the store, I&#x27;d appreciate it.  (Actually, that bit about binding the store methods doesn&#x27;t make any sense, because a Redux store isn&#x27;t a class - it&#x27;s a closure, so there&#x27;s no `this`.)</p><p>If you&#x27;re available to discuss this in a venue that may be better suited for it, please come ping me @acemarke in the Reactiflux chat channels on Discord (invite link: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reactiflux.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reactiflux.com</a> ).</p>","points":null,"parent_id":18519542,"story_id":18515565,"children":[],"options":[]}],"options":[]}],"options":[]}],"options":[]},{"id":18519062,"created_at":"2018-11-23T21:43:19.000Z","created_at_i":1543009399,"type":"comment","author":"stevebmark","title":null,"url":null,"text":"<p>I&#x27;ve always found MVC or any flavor of it to be a flawed paradigm.

The idea was to treat the game like a dynamical system where the state evolves as a function of 1) time 2) a sequence of &#x27;events&#x27;.

After that call my state object would contain something like `{..., player: {..., dying: {position: blah}}}` So other code could check `if (state.player.dying)` and access related sub-data (e.g. `state.player.dying.position`); and that part of the state would be deleted after 1.5 seconds.</p><p>2) Emitting events at key points during animations&#x2F;transitions (generally when they finish).</p><p>There was another subsystem I put in place related to this which I haven&#x27;t had to use much so far though: &#x27;contingent evolvers&#x27;, which are objects that define a `condition(state)` function and an `evolve(state, deltaTime)` function, and are automatically only executed while their condition is met.</p><p>Not positive how well this would scale to larger applications, but it has worked well for the game so far.</p><p>Source is here if you&#x27;re curious: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;westoncb&#x2F;under-game\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;westoncb&#x2F;under-game</a></p><p>[0] For those unfamiliar with GLSL &#x27;uniforms&#x27; they are variables passed into your shader from the application code.
